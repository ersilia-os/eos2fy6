    "Title": "S2DV HepG2 toxicity",
    "Description": "The model uses Word2Vec, a natural language processing technique to represent SMILES strings. The model was trained on over <2000 small molecules with associated experimental HepG2 cytotoxicity data (IC50) to classify compounds as HepG2 toxic (IC50 <= 30 uM) or non-toxic. Data was gathered from the public repository ChEMBL.",
